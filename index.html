<p>Hey, I’m Ben.</p>

<p>I’m a software engineer and amateur game developer. I’ve got at least a little bit of hands-on experience with everything from systems programming to web dev, from Python to Z80 assembly.</p>

<p>I think a lot about game design, uses for new technologies and frameworks, and <a href="/images/sylvia.png">my cat</a>. :^)</p>

<p>If you’ve got any questions, want to discuss employment, or just want to listen to me talk for hours about my #GameThoughts, feel free to get in touch!</p>

<p><img src="/images/nhnh1.png" alt="nhnh1" />
<img src="/images/nhnh2.png" alt="nhnh2" /></p>

<p><strong>No Hells, No Heavens</strong> is an in-development browser-based cooperative action-RPG, using <a href="https://github.com/HerculesWS/Hercules"><em>Hercules</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/"><em>roBrowser</em></a> as a base for the server and client.</p>

<p>Pick one of six distinct character classes and fight your way through mobs of ferocious creatures and vile demons, find some cool loot after the battle, re-arm yourself with more powerful equipment, and then do it again!</p>

<p>As your character grows stronger, you can choose to hone your skills further, or branch out and pick a second (and eventually a third!) class to gain access to new abilities. A melee mage-knight? An archer who wields healing magic? A guy that can just tank damage really well? The possibilities are literally <del>limitless</del> <strong><em>216</em></strong>!</p>

<p>NHNH is a passion project of mine that has undergone more than a couple complete system redesigns in the past however many months I’ve been working on it. I’ve finally settled on a design that I <em>really</em> like though, so expect a public playable build sooner rather than later!</p>

<h3 id="pico-8-minigames">PICO-8 Minigames</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> is a full-fledged game development environment using Lua for an imaginary game console, aptly named the PICO-8. It imposes very harsh memory, storage, and graphical limits on the developer; these constraints create a very challenging and interesting platform to work with.</p>

<p>Here’s a few of the PICO-8 games I’ve made:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bones.png" alt="bones" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicornfan.com/pico8/bones/"><strong>BONES</strong></a> is a fast-paced top-down arcade shooter. Take hold of your trusty longbow and see how long you can survive against waves of the undead!</p>

<p><img src="/images/kiwi.png" alt="kiwi" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicornfan.com/pico8/kiwi/"><strong>KIWI HD</strong></a> is a reimagining of the first game I ever made.</p>

<p><em>Kiwi Classic</em> was a high-octane platformer, requiring intense concentration and quick reflexes; <em>KIWI HD</em> brings back the gameplay that tens of fans around the world fell in love with, featuring a beautiful soundtrack, and all-new stunning 128x128 16-color graphics.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tf2t.png" alt="tf2f" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicornfan.com/pico8/tf2t/"><strong>TEXT FIGHTER 2 TURBO</strong></a> is an experiment to see how the fighting game genre would play out if it was turn-based instead of real-time.</p>

<p>Punch! Kick! Do a special move! Utilize <em>"yomi,"</em> the Japanese technique of reading the mind of the opponent, to out-wit and out-skill your barebones AI enemy!</p>

<h3 id="radial">radial</h3>

<p><img src="/images/radial.png" alt="radial" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicornfan.com/radial/"><strong>radial</strong></a> is a simple top-down arcade shooter, made for a game jam. Protect your planet against incoming waves of alien enemies and aim for the high score!</p>

<p>radial was my first attempt at using Unity, and I feel like I really learned a lot from it. For example, I learned how quaternions can be used to represent the rotation of objects in a 3D space, and I learned that I really don’t like working with Unity. :^)</p>

<h3 id="gone-to-the-dogs">Gone to the Dogs</h3>
<p><img src="/images/gttd1.png" alt="gttd1" />
<img src="/images/gttd2.png" alt="gttd2" /></p>

<p><strong>Gone to the Dogs</strong> (working title!) is an action platformer with an emphasis on exploration, inspired by the <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Momodora</em> series of games.</p>

<p>Four elemental beasts, once sealed away by an angelic warrior, have returned to the world; guide The Heroine through the caverns of Mt. Emanon, discover new powers and abilities, and slay the newly-awoken demons before they regain their full strength!</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <em>On Hold! Waiting for the stable release of GameMaker: Studio 2</em></p>

<h3 id="can-love-bloom-on-the-battlefield">Can Love Bloom on the Battlefield?</h3>

<p><img src="/images/clbotb.png" alt="clbotb" /></p>

<p><strong>Can Love Bloom on the Battlefield?</strong> is the newest <em>(possibly only?)</em> entry in the esteemed and illustrious “<em>TCG-Themed Visual Novel</em>” genre, available only on the Nintendo Game Boy!</p>

<p>Riley is sleeving up their deck for a big upcoming tournament; play through a branching story and guide Riley on the path to glorious victory, crushing defeat, or possibly even… <em>love</em>?</p>
